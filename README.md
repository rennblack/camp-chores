# camp-chores
Using ES6 Maps to create a more advanced, interactive to-do list.
This project required user-input to generate camper names and the chores were limited to the six supplied chores. Chores are chosen by the user from a drop-down. One button ("Add to Chore List") would enter the information into the map, and a second button ("Display Chore List") would display the map.
